# Get Started

# Hello World

Install **Vim** using apt-get on Ubuntu Linux:

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt search vim
$ sudo apt install vim
$ vim --version
```

Install **Vim** using [Github](https://www.vim.org/git.php):

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/vim/vim.git
```

I would recommend checking out [Vim's website](https://www.vim.org) for installation instructions.

# What is Vim?
Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text editing. <br> 
It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX systems. <br>
Vim is distributed free as charityware. <br>

Vim may seem to have a steep learning curve, but by mastering a few commands you can quickly achieve greater productivity than you could with a regular text editor.
</i>

# When do I use Vim?
- Quickly updating a file without opening an IDE.
- Editing config files
- Viewing output piped from command line

--

# When don't I use Vim?
- If I want to sit down and work on a project for awhile.
- If I want to use my mouse.
- If I want features like linters, graphical debugging, etc..

# History
- When Bram Moolenaar had bought an Amiga computer, he wanted to use the editor he learned on Unix. 
- Since there was no good Vi for the Amiga, he started with the best that was available (a program called Stevie) and started improving it.
- At first, his goal was to imitate Vi. 
- Later new functionality was added, and by version 1.22 Vim included more features than Vi. 
- That time it was renamed from Vi IMitation to Vi IMproved."

# How to get started with Vim

# Vim

### Bare Minumum Knowledge to use Vim
In my experience you can get 90% of Vim's advantages with just these simple commands.
<i>I'm sure this is sacrilege to Vim power users...but I'm not one of them yet</i>

#### Two main Modes:
- Command mode: is where you can run commands. This is the default mode in which Vim starts up.
- Insert mode: is the mode where you insert/write your text.

<i>
prefacing a movement command with a number will execute that movement multiple times. So, if you want to move up six lines, enter 6k and Vim will move the cursor up six lines. If you want to move over five words, enter 5w. To move 10 words back, use 10b.
