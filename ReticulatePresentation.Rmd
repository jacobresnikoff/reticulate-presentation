# Our Goal
 
By the end of today, you'll see that these two languages are **powerful in their own right**, and can **join forces to great effect**

---
# Background

Reticulate allows one to:

--

* Call Python from R by:
  + using the Python Interpreter in the R Console
  + Importing Python Modules
  + R Markdown
--

* Translate between R and Python objects
  + R and pandas dataframes, R matrices and NumPy arrays
--

* Flexibly bind to different versions of Python, including those in virtual and Conda environments

# Virtual Environments

---
# Virtual Environments

This is **not** an ad for Blue Apron!

--

But I think the analogy still rings true.

--

* Like pre-packaged meal boxes, virtual environments:
--

  + contain the "ingredients" and "instructions" needed to operate the package
--

  + are therefore **convenient** and **reliable** for sharing your work

# Lists

## Python

In Python we have lists, which can be composed of scalars or other objects:

```{python python list with scalars}
# lists - this list contains scalars of type integer, boolean, float, string, 
# and a list!
my_list = [27, True, 72.998, 'Jeff Jefferson III, Esquire', [3.2, 5.4]]
```

Notice the `=` we use for variable assignment; we use `==` for logical
comparisons, though. Also note that the boolean `True` has a single capital
letter.

## R

Aside from some syntax, we can do the same thing in R!

```{r r list with scalars}
# this list contains scalars of type integer, logical, numeric, character, 
# and a vector!
my_list <- list(27, TRUE, 72.998, 'Jeff Jefferson III, Esquire', c(3.2, 5.4))
```

Notice here the `<-` as well as the logical `TRUE` is fully capitalized.

---
# Hashmaps (also known as Dictionaries)

## Python

In Python dictionaries are built-in. They consist of key-value pairs:

```{python python dict}
# dictionary
my_dict = {
  'film': 'Top Gun',
  'release year': 1986,
  'star': 'Tom Cruise'}
```

## R

We have a similar object in R, although it is not a base R object type:

```{r r dict}
# we need an additional library, because hashmaps are not built-in as they are in python
library(hash)

my_hash <- hash(
  keys = c('film', 'release year', 'star'),
  values = c('Top Gun', 1986, 'Tom Cruise'))
```

---
# Arrays

## Python

Arrays are not built-in Python objects. Instead, we use the "ndarray" object
from NumPy â€” a Python package for scientific computing that isn't included in 
base Python:

```{python python array}
# arrays require the NumPy package
import numpy as np

a = np.array([1, 3, 5, 7, 9])

b = a/10

print(b, type(b))
```

Because of how the NumPy developers constructed them, NumPy arrays are
especially efficient with memory.

---
# Arrays

## R

Arrays are built-in to R, and are meant to store multi-dimensional data:

```{r r array}
# vectors are just 1-dimensional arrays!
arr <- array(seq(from = 1, to = 9, by = 2))

cat(arr/10)
class(arr)
```

---
# Functions and Control Flow

## Python

Notice the minimalist syntax...:

```{python python funcs and c-flow}

def sortOnFive(x):
    if x > 5:
        return 1
    elif x < 5:
        return -1
    else:
        return 0
         
print(sortOnFive(4), sortOnFive(5), sortOnFive(6))
```

---

# Functions and Control Flow

## R

In R, we make liberal use of curly braces:

```{r r funcs and c-flow}
# now the brackets come into play
sortOnFive <- function(x){
  if (x > 5){
    print(1)
  }
  else if (x < 5){
    print(-1)
  } else {
    print(0)
  }
}
cat(sortOnFive(4), sortOnFive(5), sortOnFive(6))
```

---

# Data Wrangling

For our examples today, we will be using a dataset on Toyota Corollas:

```{python, fetch data}
# load dependencies
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# assign data to pandas dataframe
df = pd.read_csv('data/toyota_corolla.csv')
print(type(df))
```

For data wrangling, we use pandas, which stands for Panel Data. It is analogous
to R's tidyverse and data.table libraries. 
See that we imported NumPy as well as pandas? This is because NumPy is a
dependency of pandas. Without it, pandas couldn't work its wrangling-magic.

---

# Calling the Head Method

```{python}
# call the head method
df.head()
```

Like in R, we can call head to access the first few rows of a dataframe. In
Python, though, it is referred to as a "method." We use the `.` notation to
access them.

**Methods are functions specific to a particular object type**

---
# Accessing an Attribute

Hard to see all the columns, right?

```{python}
# call columns attribute
print(df.columns)
```

---

# Value Counts and Sorting

```{python}
# find the number of cars manufactured in each year, in descending order
df['mfg_year'].value_counts().sort_values(ascending=False)
```

---

# Descriptive Statistics

```{python}
# dataframe of descriptive statistics
df.describe()
```

---

# Creating a New Column

```{python}
# divide price by weight for each observation
df['price_per_kg'] = df['price']/df['weight']

# access array
print(type(df.price_per_kg))
df.price_per_kg
```

---

# Data Visualization

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# clear axes
plt.clf()

# assign earlier mfg_counts to an object
mfg_counts = df['mfg_year'].value_counts()

# instantiate barplot
ax = plt.bar(mfg_counts.index, mfg_counts.values, color='maroon')
plt.title('Counts of Corollas by Manufacturing Year')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Count')

plt.show()

# plt.savefig('mfg-counts.png')
```

# Teaming Up

For this last one, I think this [towarddatascience article](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-seaborn-plots-in-r-using-reticulate-fb59cebf61a7)
illustrates it best. Crossing languages can be finnicky, but it can be rewarding:

```{r}
np <- import('numpy')
pd <- import('pandas')
plt <- import('matplotlib.pyplot')
sns <- import('seaborn')

# clear previous plot
plt$clf()

# load airpassengers data
df <- datasets::AirPassengers
# converting Time-Series object into an R Dataframe 
# Thx: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5331901/transforming-a-time-series-into-a-data-frame-and-back
df1 <- data.frame(tapply(df, list(year = floor(time(df)), month = month.abb[cycle(df)]), c))
df1 <- df1[month.abb]

# please note the function r_to_py() that converts R object into a python 
sns$heatmap(r_to_py(df1), fmt="g", cmap ='viridis')

# add title
plt$title('Frequency Heatmap of Flights during each Month of Respective Years')

# display the plot
plt$show()

# plt$savefig('freq-heatmap.png')
```

# Conclusions

Both Python and R have their strengths, weaknesses, and quirks. Stick to R, try Python,
or whatever path you may follow, know this: being multilingual
will only help you stretch your mind and become a more versatile data scientist.
