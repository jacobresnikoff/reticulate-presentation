# Our Goal
 
By the end of today, you'll see that these two languages are **powerful in their own right**, and can **join forces to great effect**

---
# Roadmap

*Discussion*
1. Background on Reticulate
2. Virtual Environments
3. Fundaments of Python and R
4. Data Wrangling Packages in Python and R
5. Data Visualization Packages in Python and R

*Live*
1. Load Python in RStudio
2. Demonstrate the Best of Both Worlds

# Background

A "comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R"<sup>1</sup>

That's a little verbose, eh?

When I read this, I see **a toolbox that *unites* R and Python**

# Background

Reticulate allows one to:

--

* Call Python from R by:
  +  it in the R Console
  + Importing Python Modules
  + R Markdown
--

* Translate between R and Python objects
  + R and pandas dataframes, R matrices and NumPy arrays
--

* Flexibly bind to different versions of Python, including those in virtual and Conda environments

# Virtual Environments

# Virtual Environments

This is **not** an ad for Blue Apron!

--

But I think the analogy still holds.

--

* Like pre-packaged meal boxes or shipping containers, virtual environments:
--

  + contain all the "ingredients" needed to operate the package
--

  + are therefore **convenient** and **reliable** for sharing your work

* Docker plays with this idea as well
